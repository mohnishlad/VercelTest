        <p>Of course, I can definitely help you out fixing this issue. I can check our global platform and see if there are any recents notifications or issues reported by our operations team. However, to narrow down the problem fully, is it possible that we join a bridge call to further discuss this issue? This will help us get a full understanding of the requirements and pinpoint where the issue might be happening. I can assure you that if we are able to figure out that its a platform issue, I will be escalating this to a higher level to get it resolved as soon as possible. But if it turns out to be a configuration problem, I can help you set the right redirects and resolve the issue on the bridge itself. Please let me know if you are available for meeting with me in the next few hours.</p>
